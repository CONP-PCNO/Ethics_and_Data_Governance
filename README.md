# CONP Ethics and Data Governance: Tools for Navigating Ethical Issues in Open Neuroscience

A repository for the outputs of the Ethics and Data Governance Committee of the CONP.

[See here for more information about the Committee's work.](https://conp.ca/ethics-data-governance/)

Here you will find:

* [CONP Consent Guide](https://github.com/CONP-PCNO/Ethics_and_Data_Governance/blob/main/CONP%20Consent%20Toolkit.md)
* [CONP De-Identification Guide](https://github.com/CONP-PCNO/Ethics_and_Data_Governance/blob/main/CONP%20De-Identification%20Toolkit.md)

In response to a growing need in the neuroscience community for concrete guidance concerning ethically sound and pragmatically feasible open data-sharing, the CONP has created an ‘Ethics Toolkit’. Together, these documents are meant to help researchers identify key elements in the design of their projects that are often required for the open sharing of neuroscience data, such as model consent language and approaches to de-identification.

This guidance is the product of extended discussions and careful drafting by the CONP Ethics and Governance Committee that considers both Canadian and international ethical frameworks and research practice.
