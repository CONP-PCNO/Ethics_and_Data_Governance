This document assists researchers in contributing data sets to the
Portal of the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (CONP).

The CONP accepts data sets in two situations:

1. Participants have prospectively consented to the sharing of their de-identified data through the CONP Portal.

2. Participants have not consented to the sharing of their data on the CONP Portal, but the consent given meets the core consent elements for retrospective consent.

Each of these situations will be explained.

## Part 1. Core consent elements (prospective consent)

Researchers and/or clinicians should seek consent to the sharing ofde-identified data sets through the CONP Portal prospectively. Depending on the circumstances, consent should be sought from either the prospective participant directly (first-person consent) or from their legally authorized representative (substitute consent). First-person consent is appropriate for adults with legal capacity. Substitute consent is for situations where the prospective participant lacks legal capacity either due to age (i.e., minors) or due to an inability to understand the nature and consequences of research participation (i.e., limited cognitive ability). In these circumstances, the prospective participant should be involved in the consent process to the fullest extent of their ability to do so.

In addition to the required consent elements common to research with human participants, prospective consent forms should include the following core elements to enable broad, open sharing via the CONP Portal:
<table>

<p>Coding – the removal of direct identifiers (e.g., name; health insurance number) and replaced with a code whose key is kept in a secure location</p>
<p>Anonymization – the permanent removal of direct identifiers without the conservation of any keys</p>
<p>Data synthesis – the creation of a data set with similar statistical properties as the original data set but without a one-to-one match for every variable</p></td>

**Table 1. Core consent elements for contributing data sets to the CONP Portal.**

If any of the elements in Table 1 have not been included in the informed consent documents, data sets should not be uploaded to the CONP Portal. In such circumstances, we recommend you examine the retrospective filter below. If doubts still remain, or you have questions about the suitability of these consent elements for your research, please consult with your local research ethics board.

We recognize that some research projects may choose to have a tiered consent model, whereby participants consent to only certain data types being publicly shared via the CONP Portal or other open data repository. In such circumstances, the essential consent elements are only required with respect to those data types. It is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure that data segmentation is appropriately managed so that only those data types for which consent to open data sharing has been given are shared.

See **Annex 1** for suggested clauses to include in the informed consent documentation.

## Part 2. Retrospective consent filter

Use the filter below to determine if the consent already obtained from participants will permit you to include the data on the CONP Portal.

**Step 1: Answer the following questions.**

| **Have your participants consented to:**                         | **Yes** | **No** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Deposit of de-identified data in open-access databases?          |         |        |
| Commercial use?                                                  |         |        |

**Step 2: If all your responses in step 1 were “yes”, your data can be submitted for inclusion on the CONP Portal. If any of the responses were “no”, answer the following questions.**

|                                                                                                                                                              | **Yes** | **No** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------ |
| Have your participants consented to be re-contacted?                                                                                                         |         |        |
| Is it feasible (i.e., not onerous to the degree of jeopardizing your research) to re-contact and consent your participants for inclusion on the CONP Portal? |         |        |

**Step 3: If both answers in step 2 were “yes”, re-contact your participants and obtain their consent using the example consent clauses in Annex 1. Otherwise, answer the following question.**

***NB*** Only those participants who were re-contacted and gave appropriate consent can be included in the data set included on the CONP Portal. If you have recontacted your participants and they have withheld consent, you are unlikely to obtain a waiver.
|                                                                                                                                          | **Yes** | **No** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Are you able to apply to a competent research ethics board for a waiver, i.e., an authorization to alter the initial consent parameters? |         |        |

**Step 4: If the answer in step 3 was “yes”, apply to your research ethics board for a waiver. If the answer was “no”, your data cannot be included on the CONP Portal.**

| **Version** | **Date (YYYY-MM-DD)** | **Modification summary** |

<td><strong>Re-identification</strong></td>
<td>Very low or low risk that the participant could be re-identified in the future</td>
<td>Your privacy will be protected through advanced de-identification techniques. Despite this, this is always a small risk that your shared data may one day enable someone to identify you. For example, someone could use information in your clinical record to match you in a data set. This is difficult to do because of the de-identification measures. Extensive sharing of personal information through social media or genealogical websites may also make it easier to re-identify you. With technological advances, however, it may become less difficult. Unable to foresee such advances, we use today’s best protections. In the remote chance that you are re-identified, you or your relatives may suffer a loss of privacy or potentially be subject to discrimination</td>
<td><p>Some participants worry about being identified as someone taking part in the project. The chance of this happening is extremely small [<em>consider including an estimation of such risk, such as “i.e., less than 1%”</em>], and we will do everything we can to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>Much like fingerprints, it is possible to identify someone if certain pieces of information are put together. While we use very strict data security measures to protect your privacy, there is always a small risk that your data may lead to you being re-identified. As technology advances, there may be new ways of linking data back to you that we cannot foresee today. Like other medical information, this may one day affect your insurability or your employment.</p></td>
